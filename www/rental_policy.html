<h2><i>Dress Rental Policy</i></h2>
<p id=rules>1. Only current MIT/Wellesley Ballroom Dance Team members may rent the dresses. Team members must be in good standing. Wellesley students get first priority.</p> 
<p id=rules>2. Only one costume is allowed to be checked out per style per team member.</p>
<p id=rules>3. A deposit is required at time of checking out dress. The rates are as follows:</p>
<b><p id=rules>Wellesley Students: Pay $30, get $25 back at return </p>
<p id=rules>MIT Students: Pay $40, get $30 back at return </p>
<p id=rules>MIT/ Wellesley Alum: Pay $30, get $10 back at retern</p>
<p id=rules>Affiliates: Pay $40, get $10 back at return</p></b>
<p id=rules>4. Costume must be returned in a cleaned and undamaged condition ON TIME for partial return of deposit.</p>
<p id=rules>5. All costumes need to be returned at the end of Spring (last day of Wellesley classes), except when eligible for a loan extension. Please talk to Costume Coordinator if you would like a loan extension.</p>
<p id=rules>6. You can only check out costumes of your current competitive level.</p>
<p id=rules>7. Lost or severely damaged  dresses will result in the loss of the security deposit as well as $200 fine.</p>
<p id=rules>8. Repair and/or update of the dress is encouraged. Please speak with the Costume Coordinator before updating. Please ask if assistance is needed. 
</p>
<h2><i>Dress Care</i></h2>
<p id=rules>A lot of this is common sense, but please follow these guidelines regardless. 
Try to clean your dress before you return them if they get exceptionally dirty/sweaty/smelly. 
Your dress will most likely be passed on to another team member, and I'm sure that you'd hate to get a dirty dress for competitions.</p>
<p id=rules>1. NEVER put dresses in the washer or dryer. It destroys the integrity of the dress, causes stones to fall off, and unravels fringe.
<b> HANDWASHING </b> is the best method of cleaning.</p>
<p id=rules>2. When handwashing, use lukewarm water and a mild soap/shampoo (apparently Neutrogena or Dove are good). 
Gently work the soap into the dirtier areas and rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water.</p>
<p id=rules>3. When drying the dress, <b> DO NOT WRING IT!!!</b> 
It will stretch out and ruin the dress's original shape. 
Gently squeeze out the water and dry with a towel if needed. 
Lay the dress OUT FLAT (don't hang) to dry on a towel. 
Do not dry in the sun or on a heater. 
When your dress is dry, fold and store in a drawer.</p>
<p id=rules>4. It is not recommended to hang your dress when storing/drying because the straps might stretch out or the dress will lose its shape. 
If your dress is made of a satin material rather than a lycra (stretchy) material and isn't too heavy, you could probably hang it.</p>
<p id=rules>5. After competitions, please let your dress air out (especially if you get it sweaty) for a day before storing. 
Otherwise, your dress can get mildew-y and dampness can contribute to deterioration of the fabric.</p>
<p id=rules>6. If your dress is wrinkled, I recommend using a steamer to get them out! </p>
